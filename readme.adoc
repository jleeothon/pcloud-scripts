= pCloud scripts

Collection of scripts to keep my pCloud organised.

These scripts rely on environment variables: `ACCESS_TOKEN`, `FOLDER_ID`.

== intersects.js

Inside `FOLDER_ID`, given a (flat) group of folders with pictures, prints folder names in groups such that all folder names in a group have pictures with matching hashes.

== dups.js

Inside `FOLDER_ID`, given a (flat) group of folders with pictures, finds pictures with duplicate hashes, and keeps the one with the oldest creation or modification date.
